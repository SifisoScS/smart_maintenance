# 🧱 **Smart Maintenance Management System (SMMS)**

### *A Modern, Intelligent Platform for Managing Maintenance Operations*

---

## 🌍 **Vision**

To create a **smart, efficient, and transparent system** that simplifies how organizations manage maintenance operations — from request submission to completion — while showcasing the power of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** and **Software Design Patterns** in a full-stack architecture.

---

## 🎯 **Mission**

Our mission is to build a platform that:

* Empowers users to **log and track maintenance issues** in real time.
* Helps technicians and administrators **organize, assign, and monitor maintenance tasks** effectively.
* Demonstrates **clean software architecture** and **scalable design** that mirrors real enterprise solutions.
* Serves as a **portfolio-grade learning project**, highlighting OOP, design patterns, and full-stack integration between **Flask (Python)** and **Blazor (.NET)**.

---

## 💡 **Project Overview**

The **Smart Maintenance Management System (SMMS)** is a **full-stack web application** designed to manage all aspects of maintenance within an organization.

It acts as a centralized platform where:

* Employees can **submit maintenance requests** (e.g., electrical, plumbing, or IT-related).
* Technicians can **view and update task progress**.
* Administrators can **assign technicians**, monitor activity, and analyze maintenance data using an interactive dashboard.

---

## 🧠 **Key Objectives**

1. **Demonstrate strong OOP design** using well-structured classes and encapsulation.
2. **Apply core design patterns** like Factory, Repository, Strategy, Observer, and Singleton.
3. **Implement a clean, layered architecture** that separates responsibilities clearly.
4. **Integrate Flask and Blazor** to illustrate how Python and C# can coexist in a modern full-stack system.
5. **Deliver a real-world use case** that can evolve into a deployable maintenance management solution.

## ⚙️ **System Architecture**

### 🧩 **Backend (Flask - Python)**

The backend is responsible for data management, business logic, and API communication.
It follows a **multi-layered structure**:

* **Models Layer** – Defines data structures like `User`, `Asset`, and `MaintenanceRequest`.
* **Repositories Layer** – Encapsulates all database operations using the **Repository Pattern**.
* **Services Layer** – Implements core business logic and applies patterns like **Strategy** and **Observer**.
* **Controllers Layer** – Handles HTTP requests and responses via **Flask Blueprints**.
* **Patterns Module** – Houses reusable pattern implementations (Factory, Singleton, etc.).

**Backend Stack:**

* Python 3.x
* Flask
* SQLAlchemy ORM
* JWT Authentication
* SQLite or SQL Server

---

### 💻 **Frontend (Blazor - C#)**

The frontend delivers a modern, responsive interface where users interact with the system.

It includes:

* **Request submission and tracking pages** for clients.
* **Technician dashboards** to view and update assigned jobs.
* **Admin panel** with charts and analytics for system monitoring.

**Frontend Stack:**

* Blazor WebAssembly (C#)
* Bootstrap / Tailwind for styling
* HttpClient for REST API calls to Flask
* Chart.js / Recharts for analytics visualization

## 🧱 **Key Features**

| Module                   | Description                                                                   |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **User Management**      | Role-based authentication for Admins, Technicians, and Clients.               |
| **Maintenance Requests** | Create, assign, track, and complete maintenance jobs.                         |
| **Asset Management**     | Store and monitor organizational assets by category, location, and condition. |
| **Notification System**  | Observer pattern sends notifications when requests are updated or completed.  |
| **Analytics Dashboard**  | Interactive charts showing performance, task status, and technician workload. |

## 🧩 **Design Patterns in Action**

| Pattern                       | Description                                                                  | Implementation Example                           |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Factory**                   | Creates specialized maintenance request objects (Electrical, Plumbing, etc.) | `MaintenanceRequestFactory.create_request(type)` |
| **Repository**                | Abstracts data access for modularity and testability                         | `UserRepository`, `RequestRepository`            |
| **Observer**                  | Sends automatic notifications when requests change                           | Notifies Admin/Technician of status updates      |
| **Strategy**                  | Supports different notification types (Email, In-App)                        | `EmailNotification` vs `InAppNotification`       |
| **Singleton**                 | Manages centralized app configuration or database session                    | `ConfigManager` or `DatabaseConnection`          |
| **Dependency Injection (DI)** | Passes services into controllers dynamically                                 | Injecting `MaintenanceService` into Flask routes |

---

## 🧩 **Example Workflow**

1. **A user submits** a maintenance request via the Blazor interface.
2. **Flask backend** creates a corresponding `MaintenanceRequest` object using the **Factory pattern**.
3. The **RequestRepository** saves the request to the database.
4. Once assigned, the **Observer pattern** triggers a notification to the selected technician.
5. The technician updates progress, which is reflected instantly on the admin’s dashboard.
6. The **Strategy pattern** determines whether to send an email or in-app update.
